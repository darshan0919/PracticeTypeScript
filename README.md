# TypeScript

* TypeScript is OOP version and superset of javascript (with optional restrictions on data types)

* Install using "npm i -g typescript"
* Compile typescript to javascript live using "tsc filename.ts -w" command, tsc is called transpiler.

* const & let are block level variables, and can only be declared once in the scope.
* const variable must be assigned value when declared.
